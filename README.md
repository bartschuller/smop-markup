smop-markup
===========

Macro-enabled markup support using SIP-11 interpolation.

Say What?

XML strings in Scala source code, parsed at compile time (including compile
failures for wellformedness errors), translated to the object model of
your choice: Scala-XML, Anti-XML, ScalesXML, you name it.

Also: interpolation, with the types checked at compile time.
